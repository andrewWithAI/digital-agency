      priority: 1.0,
    },

      lastmod: new Date().toISOString(),
      changefreq: 'weekly',
      priority: 0.9,
    },
    // Add dynamic entries for services
    ...services.map((service) => ({
      loc: `${baseUrl}/services/${service.slug}`,
      lastmod: service.updatedAt,
      changefreq: 'monthly',
