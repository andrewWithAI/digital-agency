This document outlines the deployment and DevOps strategy for the Talty Tech Solutions website, focusing on infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and operational best practices.

## Deployment Goals

- Implement reliable, automated deployment processes
- Ensure high availability and performance in production
- Establish proper environments for development, testing, and production
- Enable easy rollbacks and disaster recovery
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Maintain security best practices throughout the infrastructure

## Infrastructure Architecture

### Hosting Platform

We will use Vercel as our primary hosting platform due to its excellent integration with Next.js and its global edge network.

#### Benefits of Vercel
- Native Next.js support with optimized builds
- Global CDN with edge caching
- Automatic HTTPS and SSL management
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Serverless functions for API routes
- Built-in analytics and monitoring

### Environment Strategy

We will maintain three primary environments:

1. **Development Environment**
   - Purpose: Active development and feature testing
   - Deployment: Automatic from the `develop` branch
   - URL: `dev.thompsondigital.com`
   - Features: Full debugging, non-minified code

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Purpose: Pre-production testing and client review
   - Deployment: Manual promotion from development
   - URL: `staging.thompsondigital.com`
   - Features: Production-like settings, staging data

3. **Production Environment**
   - Purpose: Live website for end users
   - Deployment: Manual promotion from staging
   - URL: `thompsondigital.com`
   - Features: Optimized performance, live data

### Infrastructure as Code

We will use Terraform to manage infrastructure configuration:

```hcl
# Example Terraform configuration for Vercel project
provider "vercel" {
  api_token = var.vercel_api_token
}

resource "vercel_project" "thompson_digital" {
  name      = "thompson-digital"
  framework = "nextjs"
  
  git_repository = {
    type = "github"
    repo = "thompson-digital/digital-agency"
  }
  
  environment = [
    {
      key    = "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL"
      value  = "https://api.thompsondigital.com"
      target = ["production", "preview", "development"]
    },
    {
      key    = "NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID"
      value  = var.analytics_id
      target = ["production"]
    }
  ]
}

resource "vercel_domain" "production" {
  project_id = vercel_project.thompson_digital.id
  domain     = "thompsondigital.com"
}

resource "vercel_domain" "staging" {
  project_id = vercel_project.thompson_digital.id
  domain     = "staging.thompsondigital.com"
}

resource "vercel_domain" "development" {
  project_id = vercel_project.thompson_digital.id
  domain     = "dev.thompsondigital.com"
}
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

We will use GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop, main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: Unit tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  e2e:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Cypress run
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          build: npm run build
          start: npm start
```

### Continuous Deployment

We will use Vercel's GitHub integration for continuous deployment:

#### Development Deployments
- Automatically deploy all commits to the `develop` branch
- Generate unique preview URLs for all pull requests
- Run post-deployment tests to verify functionality

#### Staging Deployments
- Manually promote builds from development to staging
- Run full test suite on staging environment
- Perform automated accessibility and performance tests

#### Production Deployments
- Manually promote builds from staging to production
- Deploy during low-traffic periods
- Implement canary deployments for critical updates

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   - Developer creates feature branch from `develop`
   - Pull request created with preview deployment
   - Automated tests run on preview deployment
   - Code review and approval

2. **Development Deployment**
   - Merged PR automatically deploys to development
   - Integration tests run on development environment
   - QA team verifies new features

3. **Staging Deployment**
   - Release manager promotes build to staging
   - Full regression testing on staging
   - Client/stakeholder review and approval

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Release manager promotes build to production
   - Canary deployment (10% of traffic)
   - Monitoring for errors or performance issues
   - Gradual rollout to 100% of traffic

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

We will manage environment variables securely:

- Store sensitive variables in Vercel's environment variable system
- Use different values for different environments
- Never commit sensitive values to the repository

#### Environment Variable Categories

1. **Build-time Variables**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables for client-side code
   - Build configuration settings

2. **Runtime Variables**
   - API keys and secrets
   - Service connection strings
   - Feature flags

3. **Environment-specific Variables**
   - API endpoints for different environments
   - Feature flags for specific environments
   - Analytics and monitoring settings

### Secret Management

- Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables for secrets
- Implement GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD
- Rotate secrets regularly according to security policy

## Monitoring and Observability

### Performance Monitoring

We will use Vercel Analytics and additional tools for performance monitoring:

- **Core Web Vitals Tracking**
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - First Input Delay (FID)
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
  - Page load times
  - Time to Interactive
  - User interactions
  - Geographic performance

- **Synthetic Monitoring**
  - Regular Lighthouse audits
  - Scheduled performance tests
  - Uptime monitoring

### Error Tracking

We will use Sentry for error tracking and monitoring:

```javascript
// _app.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
    environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT,
    tracesSampleRate: 0.5,
  });
}

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

### Logging Strategy

We will implement structured logging:

- Use JSON format for machine-readable logs
- Include context with each log (user, session, request ID)
- Implement log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Centralize logs in a log management system

```javascript
// logger.js
const logger = {
  info: (message, context = {}) => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify({
      level: 'info',
      message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      ...context
    }));
  },
  error: (message, error, context = {}) => {
    console.error(JSON.stringify({
      level: 'error',
      message,
      error: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      ...context
    }));
    
    // Also send to error tracking
    Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: context });
  }
};

export default logger;
```

### Alerting System

We will implement alerts for critical issues:

- **Performance Alerts**
  - Core Web Vitals degradation
  - Slow API responses
  - High error rates

- **Availability Alerts**
  - Service downtime
  - API failures
  - Third-party service issues

- **Security Alerts**
  - Unusual traffic patterns
  - Authentication failures
  - Dependency vulnerabilities

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

Vercel automatically handles horizontal scaling, but we will:

- Optimize for edge caching
- Implement efficient serverless functions
- Use appropriate caching strategies

### Content Delivery

We will optimize content delivery:

- Use Vercel's global CDN
- Implement proper cache headers
- Optimize assets for global delivery

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/static/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

### Database Scaling (If Applicable)

If the project includes a database:

- Use managed database services
- Implement connection pooling
- Set up read replicas for high-traffic scenarios
- Implement proper indexing and query optimization

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Code and Configuration**
  - Git repository with multiple remotes
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) in version control

- **Content and Data**
  - Regular database backups (if applicable)
  - CMS content exports
  - Asset backups

### Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **Incident Response**
   - Defined incident severity levels
   - Clear escalation paths
   - Communication templates

2. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Rollback to last known good deployment
   - Database restore procedures
   - DNS failover process

3. **Testing**
   - Regular disaster recovery drills
   - Backup restoration testing
   - Documentation updates

## Security Practices
