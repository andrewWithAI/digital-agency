## Component Library Development

To improve maintainability and consistency, we'll develop a comprehensive component library:

1. **Button Component**
   - Primary, secondary, outline variants
   - Different sizes (sm, md, lg)
   - Icon support (left, right)
   - Loading state

2. **Card Component**
   - Basic, interactive, and feature variants
   - Consistent padding and styling
   - Support for header, body, footer sections

3. **Form Components**
   - Input with validation
   - Select with custom styling
   - Checkbox and radio buttons
   - Form groups and layouts

4. **Typography Components**
   - Heading (h1-h6) with consistent styling
   - Paragraph with size variants
   - Lists (ordered, unordered)
   - Blockquote and code blocks

### Layout Components
1. **Container**
   - Consistent max-width and padding
   - Responsive behavior

2. **Grid System**
   - Flexible grid layouts
   - Responsive column configurations

3. **Section**
   - Consistent vertical spacing
   - Background variants

### Animation System
1. **Transition Components**
   - Fade, slide, scale transitions
   - Staggered animations for lists

2. **Animation Hooks**
   - useInView for scroll-triggered animations
   - useTransition for state transitions

## Technical Debt Mitigation

To address potential technical debt:

1. **Code Duplication**
   - Identify and refactor repeated patterns
   - Create utility functions for common operations

2. **Type Safety**
   - Ensure comprehensive type coverage
   - Avoid any/unknown types where possible

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - Identify and optimize expensive operations
   - Implement memoization where appropriate

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular updates of dependencies
   - Minimize unnecessary dependencies

## Next Steps

2. Start development of the About page
3. Set up the testing infrastructure
4. Implement SEO enhancements for existing pages
5. Begin performance optimization for current components
